//! Tmux implements a termio backend for tmux control mode panes. Unlike the
//! exec backend, this does not spawn a subprocess or allocate a pty. Instead,
//! it routes terminal I/O through a tmux control mode connection that is
//! owned by a parent terminal surface.
//!
//! User input (keyboard, paste, etc.) is formatted as tmux `send-keys -H`
//! commands targeting a specific pane, and written to the control connection
//! via the ControlWriter interface. The `ParentWriter` implementation routes
//! commands through the parent terminal's termio mailbox, which writes them
//! to the pty connected to `tmux -CC`. The parent terminal's stream handler
//! is responsible for routing `%output` notifications back to this backend's
//! terminal.
//!
//! This backend's types are always compiled into the backend union so that
//! switch exhaustiveness checks cover it. Actual usage (creating a tmux
//! surface) is gated at call sites by `tmux_control_mode` build option.
//!
//! ## Threading
//!
//! The ControlWriter is invoked on the IO thread of the child surface.
//! The `ParentWriter` implementation posts write requests to the parent's
//! SPSC termio mailbox. See `ParentWriter` doc comments for the full
//! threading contract. `apprt.surface.SurfaceRelayWriter` provides the
//! cross-thread relay path through the app mailbox.

/// mailbox. This preserves the SPSC invariant: the parent's IO thread
/// remains the single producer.
